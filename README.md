### Bouncer

A little Go app to trigger a relay to power cycle (bounce) my modem whenever it determines network connectivity to be... "insufficient". Takes a lot of inspiration from the likes of load balancer health checking in order to prevent bouncing the modem when not necessary, giving it time to recover, etc.
